# Microbial Swarm Simulation

A swarm simulates the behavior of a swarm of microbes. They grow in a grid that filled with nutrients 
and live, die or split depending on wheather they eat enough, or not enough. Nutrients will be replenished 
periodically in a defined behavior as well. 

Eventually optimization will 
be added, so each microbe's behavior will change based on what the optimization parameter is e.g. individual's age, 
or overall swarm's health. 

Animation is done using Java Swing Library.
